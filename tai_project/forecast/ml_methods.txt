

I used a neural network with the hidden layer dimension (7,6) for the forecast. 
I trained the net for 15 epochs since I realised that the loss curve does not decrease significantly after that. 

As input, I used the temperature, windspeed- and direction and precipitation (6h). 
The input dimension was (12, len(input)), since I provided for each variable one timestep before and after as well
(For each series of 20 values which corresponds to five days). For the first value in these 20 I provided the first one 
twice, for the last one in a series of twenty, I provided the last one twice. This is, because providing the one before 
(in case of the first value) or the one after (in case of the last value) corresponds to the five day forecast series 
of the next day.
